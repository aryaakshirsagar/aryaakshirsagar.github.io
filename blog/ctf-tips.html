    <h1>CTF Tips from a Fellow Player</h1>
    <p>
        Not an expert here — just someone who’s been down the rabbit hole of CTFs at 2 AM with too much coffee.
        These are some notes I wish I had when I started.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Read the Question Slowly</h2>
    <p>
        First mistake I used to make — rushing. Take a breath, read it twice.
        Sometimes the challenge literally tells you the answer if you slow down.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Keep a Scratchpad</h2>
    <p>
        Open up a Notion page, text file, or even pen & paper.  
        Jot down commands, hints, random strings you find.  
        Your future self will thank you.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Small Wins > Staring at One Challenge Forever</h2>
    <p>
        Stuck for more than 20–30 mins? Park it. Go get some easy flags to keep morale up.
        You can always come back with a fresh brain.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Learn the Basics (Really)</h2>
    <p>
        A lot of CTF challenges are just “basic” commands in disguise.  
        Stuff like <code>strings</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>file</code>, <code>base64</code> decoding, and simple scripting
        solves more challenges than you think.
    </p>

    <div class="note">
        💡 Bonus: Have <code>cyberchef</code> bookmarked.  
        It’s like a Swiss Army knife for encoding/decoding and random transformations.
    </div>

    <h2>5. Play with Friends</h2>
    <p>
        CTFs are way more fun in a team.  
        Plus, you’ll learn way faster when you see how others approach problems.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:2rem; font-size:0.9rem; color:#666;">
        That’s all for now — I’ll drop more tips as I keep playing.  
        Good luck, and may your flags be real and your hints be kind.
